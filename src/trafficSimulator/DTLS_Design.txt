Upadte Nodes Pseudo Code Algorithm for DTLS:

    for all nodes:
        for all incoming roads:
            find nearest car in evrey node
            find min priorty in cars
            elimnate all cars from priorty array that dosn't equal the min priorty in the priorty array
            if priorty array len > 1:
                if exsist conflict: (if cars have joined vertex that is part of the node)
                    settle the conflict:
                    the winner is the one with the min number of edges from the joined conflicted vertex
                else:
                    continue (do nothing)
            else: (no cars in the node or there is a winning priorty one)
                go by priorty
